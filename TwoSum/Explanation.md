# Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add
up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
use the same element twice.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
## Thoughts

1. integers, so there might be negative numbers
2. reorder the array from small to large
3.
